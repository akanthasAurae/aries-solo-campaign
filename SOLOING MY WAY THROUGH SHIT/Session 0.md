	 	A rather large expanse of arctic terrain, dotted off by a small forest. Returning from his latest batch of trouble, Atthanli finds a gap through the poorly maintained walls of the city of Bitterwind, pulling his coat over his head and ducking below one of the roof overhangs he'd found.
	 	From what he could tell, the city, albeit small, was in shambles -- finding the walls to have been chipped, roofs with burn marks singed off by snow, blood staining the fresh coat of white. His eyes narrow, leaning down as he brushes his claws on the stains...

## ==INVESTIGATION CHECK: DC 5
## --> d20+3 = 8(+3) = 11==

	A conquer. No, a *genocide,* wiping out any sort of life from this place, any sort of authority, of community. This would, usually, leave someone quite floored, but to someone like Atthanli - cold, immoral and horrible - all he saw was opportunity in this ranshacked place, filled to the very brim with death. Who was going to stop him if he did a little digging around in this misery?

### ==Are there monsters? --> Absolute certainty, yes==
## ORACLE; 1 male tiefling, Acolyte. 75 xp.
### ==Does he notice the acolyte? --> 19, yes==

	With care, Atthanli drifts through the snow ever so slightly only to notice a figure - much like himself, bearing religious robes yet horns... A tiefling? How fascinating...
### ==Does he maintain stealth? --> 17, yes ==

	He squeezes by, unnoticed, with a soft shiver through the snow... Wielding his dagger in his hand, Atthanli prepares to stealth strike upon this lone acolyte...

### ==Does Atthanli get the urge for blood? --> 18, yes==

	Witnessing before him spilled blood, of his own kin, he gasps- still holding his head from the fumbled hit to his head. It pounds. It aches. It yearns for blood. It demands blood.
	He crouches. He shivers, he gasps again, gasps for breath, sucks in the cold air as if it would sate the need for blood without it so much as coating his throat. His eyes widen, his jaw goes slack as his black tongue runs across the slit in the acolyte's throat. He drinks as if he's been thirsty for millenia, for longer, for eternities. He feasts. 
### ==Does it finally sate him? --> 3, no==

	 It isn't enough. His teeth find purchase in the boiling hot flesh, staining further his pearly skin and fur crimson, gulping down chunks of muscle and vein together with the blood. After long enough, he rears his head back, inhaling through bloodied teeth in pure relief of his meal. Lucky him that nobody's noticed or interrupted... perhaps, with how he'd brutalised this corpse now, they would suspect it to just be a wolf's doing or similar.
	 He wipes his mouth clean, rubbing off the fresh yet drying blood off on the side of his cloak, thanking the gods for it being so dark in colour already. He ransacks the corpse, only to find...
##### ==Loot: 12gp & a holy trinket==
	He then proceeds to cast the trinket into the snow, far from him. No thanks. 

### ==How populated/big is this city? --> Hamlet==

	Atthanli carefully dodges and weaves between the already ranshacked homes...
#### ==does he find anything? --> Unlikely. | 2 out of 5 houses had some form of loot.
###### Loot: 16sp + an old divination card he cannot read +==  *an invitation to a party where he knows a murder happened*
## CLUE | Keywords Table
### 1. **Vessel** | 2. **Flee** | 3. **Temple**
	Something fascinating about a "party" at a temple, resulting in the murder of thousands-- Atthanli wasn't one for news, but this had happened quite recently, in less than three months. It was before winter struck... Stories say the vessels of the temple's god attempted to flee, only to be caught in disaster.
